********************** P M R *************************
<+s>: I understood how to collect user input to achieve the desired passcode, and
I understood how to generate the passcodes.

<-s>: I struggled a lot with the format and logic of the program, and I went through
multiple drafts of pseudocode before finally understanding the most logical
procedure to completing this.
******************************************************
In the future: I plan on reviewing and studying this entire program specifically; 
this code contains a lot of complex iteratives and loops that I need to work on
and remember.
